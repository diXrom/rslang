## RS Lang

Final group project at RSSchool (EPAM) for 3 people, but only 2 people participated in the development. This app helps people in learning English. Ideas were implemented with [lingualeo.com](https://lingualeo.com/).

### What are the benefits of our application?
You can start learning words with flashcards. Or you can learn new words by playing one of the two Sprint or Audio Challenge games. A statistics page is also available to track your progress. Just check it out for yourself! [RSLang](https://dixrom.github.io/rslang/#/)
